<p>
Understanding the role of dislocations and grain boundary evolution in the
plastic deformation of materials continues to present an important and 
interesting challenge for material scientists.  We studied both of these 
microstructural entities using mesoscopic computational models based on 
the level set method. 
</p>

<p>
In our model, dislocations are represented by the intersection of the zero
level sets of two level set functions.  An important consequence of this
<em>implicit</em> representation of the dislocation line is that topological
changes that occur when dislocation lines interact with obstacles and
with each other take place automatically without requiring complicated
``surgical procedures.''  
</p>

<p>
To address the computational complexity of modeling dislocation
networks and grain boundaries using the level set method, we have 
implemented the <a href="http://ktchu.serendipityresearch.org/software/lsmdd/index.html">Level Set Method 
Dislocation Dyanmics (LSMDD)</a> library.  This software library is
designed to support high-performance, parallel computation and to be 
modular enough to allow for exploration of novel numerical models and 
algorithms for simulating dislocation dynamics and interactions.
