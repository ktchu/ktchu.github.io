<h2>
  Effects of Numerical Core Size on Dislocation Stress Fields 
</h2>
<p>
Use of finite sized dislocation cores (i.e. smearing) in numerical 
calculations causes deviations in the stress fields on the order of 
the square of the numerical core radius.  This deviation is negligible 
far from the dislocation core but causes significant errors in the 
stress fields near the dislocation core.  While using a smaller 
dislocation core size reduces the magnitude of the error throughout 
the entire stress field, using the numerical core size as the physical
core size actually leads to errors near the dislocation core that
increase as the size of the numerical core is decreased (even with the
use of finer grids).  The following results show the effects of the 
numerical core on the error in the stress fields outside of the 
numerical and physical dislocation core.
</p>

<p>
One of the motivations for investigating these errors further is that 
they result in spurious forces between dislocation lines when they are
near each other.  For instance, we have seen a nonzero force that should
be exactly zero (shown analytically) that leads to drift in a dislocation
model of a grain boundary.  These spurious forces also cause an apparent
repulsive force between dislocations that should physically react to
form a single dislocation.
</p>

<p>
For all of the results, the dislocation configuration is taken to be
an array of edge dislocations with Burgers vector in the (1,0,0)
direction and line direction in the (0,0,1) direction.  The array
ordered such that the normal to the plane of the dislocation array is
in the (1,0,0) direction.  The dislocation array is periodically
repeated in the x-direction.  The simulation cells is [-50,50]x[-40,40],
which implies that the inter-dislocation spacing is 80 and the
distance between periodic images of the dislocation array is 100.

<h3> Effect of Grid Resolution </h3>
Refining the grid does not reduce the error.  Once the grid resolution
is fine enough (does not need to be that fine thanks to the accuracy of 
the FFT), the error in the stress is dominated by error caused by using a 
smeared core.

Error in stress field outside the dislocation core is independent

<h3> Dependence of Error on Numerical Core Size </h3>
The error caused by the finite core scales as the square of the numerical
core radius.  We can intuitively understand the scaling of this error
by considering the representation of a single edge dislocation as a 
decomposition of two dislocations each with half of the Burgers vector 
of the original dislocation and separated by a distance equal to the core 
radius.  Using the perturbed positions of the two dislocations in the 
formulas for the stress fields results in a leading order deviation of 
the stress field at any position space that is on the order of the core 
radius squared.

core radius.  Here the physical core radius is fixed at 4 and

<h3> Increasing Error when Physical Core and Numerical Core are Equal </h3>
The choice of taking the physical core size to be the same as the 
numerical core size leads to an error in the stress fields around the 
dislocation core that increases with decreasing core size.

core radius.  Here the grid resolution is fixed at 0.25.

<h3> Improved Accuracy Near Core Using Higher-order Smoothed Delta Functions </h3>
Higher-order smoothed delta functions can be used decrease the error caused 
by the smeared core.  They decrease the error by concentrating the 
distribution of the smeared core near the true position of the dislocation
core.  However, a larger number of grid points are required
to resolve the numerical core when higher-order smoothed delta functions 
are used.  Second-order delta functions seem to give a reasonable compromise 
between accuracy in the stress fields and the grid spacing required to resolve
the numerical core.
<ul>
  
  <li>First-order smoothed delta functions require ~6 grid cells within the
  dislocation core (core radius = 3 grid cells) to eliminate inaccuracies
  due to grid resolution.
  </li>

  <li>Second-order smoothed delta functions require ~8-12 grid cells within the
  dislocation core (core radius = 4-6 grid cells) to eliminate inaccuracies
  due to grid resolution.
  </li>

  <li>Third-order smoothed delta functions require ~24-48 grid cells within the
  dislocation core (core radius = 12-24 grid cells) to eliminate 
  inaccuracies due to grid resolution.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
The following results were obtained on a grid with dx = dy = 0.125 for 
first- and second-order smoothed delta functions and dx = dy = 0.041667 
for the third-order smoothed delta function to remove grid resolution 
inaccuracies.

<h3> Summary/Conclusions </h3>
When doing dislocation dynamics simulations, the stress field calculations 
should use a numerical core that is many times smaller than the desired
physical core.  Based on these computational experiments with a physical 
core radius on the order of a few times the Burgers vector and when
using the first-order smoothed delta function to smear the core, the 
numerical core should be about 10 times smaller for the error in the 
stress fields to be on the order of 1e-4.  When the second-order smoothed
delta function is used, the numerical core can be taken to be larger (on 
the order of 2 to 4 times smaller than physical core) to achieve the same 
accuracy.  

<p>
Based on the results of these computational experiments, we should
be using second-order smoothed delta functions with a numerical core that
is about 2 to 4 times smaller than the physical core radius.  This implies
the use of a grid resolution that places at least 10-20 grid points
within the radius of the desired physical dislocation core.
