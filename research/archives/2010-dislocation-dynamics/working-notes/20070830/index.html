<h2>
  Comparison of Nonsingular Dislocation Theory with Results of Numerically Smeared Cores
</h2>

<h3> Abstract </h3>
Analytically smearing of the dislocation core to remove the singularity 
inherent in theory of infinitely thin dislocations results in the errors 
of the same order of magnitude in those that arise when the dislocation 
core is smeared numerically.


<h3> Methodology </h3>
<ul>

  <li> For all of the results, the dislocation configuration is taken to be
  an array of edge dislocations with Burgers vector in the (1,0,0)
  direction and line direction in the (0,0,1) direction.  The array
  ordered such that the normal to the plane of the dislocation array is
  in the (1,0,0) direction.  The dislocation array is periodically
  repeated in the x-direction.  The simulation cells is [-50,50]x[-40,40],
  which implies that the inter-dislocation spacing is 80 and the
  distance between periodic images of the dislocation array is 100.
  </li>

  <li>The stress fields for the nonsingular theory of dislocations account
  for the fact that there are an infinite number of periodic image 
  dislocations in the y-direction.  The formulae for infinite, periodic
  dislocation arrays were derived by using the formulas in section 19-5
  of Hirth/Lothe with expressions for the stress fields from Cai 2006.

  </li>
  
  <li>The analytical stress fields include one periodic image of the 
  dislocation array in the x-direction.
  </li>

  <li>All calculations are on a uniform grid with dx = dy using the 
  Fourier transform formulation in Xiang et. al.
  </li>

  <li>The errors for the stress fields are only computed OUTSIDE of the
  specified physical core.

<h3> Dependence of Error on Core Size Parameter</h3>
Both analytical and numerical smearing of the core yield an error in the
stress field outside of the physical core region.  These errors have the 
same order of magnitude.  However, the error in the nonsingular theory is 
systematically larger than the error in the numerical solution.

<h3> Increasing Error when Physical Core and Core Size Paramter are Equal </h3>
The choice of taking the physical core size to be the same as the 
core size parameter leads to an error in the stress fields around the 
dislocation core that increases with decreasing core size.  This effect
is present in both the analytical and numerical solutions.

<h3> Comparison of Difference Between Nonsingular Theory and Numerical 
Solution</h3>
The difference between the nonsingular theory is nontrivial but decreases
as we shrink both the numerical core radius and the core radius parameter
in the nonsingular theory.  It appears that using a smaller core radius
parameter in the nonsingular theory decreases the difference between the
nonsingular theory and the numerical solutions.

<h3> Summary/Conclusions </h3>
At distances near the physical core size, any theory of dislocations that 
distributes the core over a finite region that is on the order of the 
physical core size leads to significant deviations from the stress fields 
for infinitely thin dislocation lines.  For the nonsingular theory 
developed by Cai et. al., the deviations have roughly the same scaling
and same order of magnitude as the errors in the numerical solution. 

<p>
Any dislocation dynamics simulations that removes the singularity by
smearing the dislocation core to a width on the order of the "physical 
core size" will show the same problems as our level set based simulation.
