  Steady electrochemical transport around a polarizable sphere immersed in an
  electrolyte solution when a large, uniform electric field is applied:
  concentration profile of neutral salt (top) and diffusion currents (bottom).
  In these two images, the electric field is aligned with the z-axis.

Novel electrochemical devices being explored for microfluidic and
micro/nano-power source applications often electrochemical systems into
operating regimes that test the limits of traditional macroscopic theories in
electrochemistry.  We study electrochemical transport in these extreme
operating regimes by analyzing the classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations
using asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations

One of the main conclusions of our work is that for weak electrolytes, large
concentration gradients develop even at relatively small applied electric
fields/voltages.  These concentration gradients imply that the common
approach of modeling electrochemical transport using linear circuit models
is questionable for systems driven by strong electric fields/voltages.

Using novel asymptotic analysis techniques, we have also formally derived
effective <em>nonlinear</em> electrochemical transport equations in the
thin double-layer limit, which generalize linear circuit models
{% cite 2007-Chu_Bazant-JCIS %}. The foundation for this work is a novel
formulation of surface conservation laws which allows us to derive effective
boundary conditions that capture the physics of the double layer <em>without</em>
requiring linearization of the concentration and potential fields.
