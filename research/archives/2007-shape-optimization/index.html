  Schoen G triply periodic, minimal surface generated by minimizing the
  total surface area under a constraint in the voulme fractions of the
  two regions separated by the surface.  The optimization procedure
  used to generate this surface is based on a variational level set method
  approach.  The simulation that generated this figure was implemented using

<p>
The level set method is naturally suited to shape optimization problems
where the objective function and constraints are representable (possibly
implicitly) as a functionals of the level set function.  In these situations,
it is possible to use variational calculus to devise a constrained, steepest
descent optimization procedure.  In addition to yielding a computational
procedure, the variational level set method approach also provides us with
a means to theoretically characterize optimal surfaces.

<p>
Using a variational, level set-based shape optimization approach, we
investigated the properties of triply periodic microstructures.  Specifically,
we explored the structure of triply periodic surfaces that minimize the total
surface area while satisfying a constraint on the volume fractions of the two
phases it separates.  The main outcomes of this work were
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a proof that surfaces that optimize the total surface area under a
  volume fraction constraint are precisely those possessing a constant
  mean curvature;
  </li>
  <li>a computational exploration of the properties of optimal structures
  as a function of the the volume fractions of the two phases separated by
  surface.
  </li>
</ul>
