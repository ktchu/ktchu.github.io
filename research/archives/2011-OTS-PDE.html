title: Optimal Time Step Selection for Finite Difference Schemes for PDEs 
title-tab: Research | OTS-PDE

<p>
It is possible to boost the order of accuracy of finite difference schemes 
for time dependent PDEs by carefully choosing the time step.  The key 
consequence of this result is that it may be possible to transform formally
low-order accurate finite difference schemes into high-order accurate 
numerical methods with very little modification of both the original 
numerical algorithm and software implementation.  A more detailed discussion
about optimal time step selection may be found
