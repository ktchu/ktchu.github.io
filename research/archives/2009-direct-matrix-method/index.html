title: Direct Matrix Method for Computing Jacobians of Discretized Nonlinear Integro-Differential Operators
title-tab: Research | DMM

<p>
Computation of the Jacobian for discretized nonlinear integro-differential
equations is an important step for many numerical algorithms.  The direct
matrix (or operator) method for analytically computing the Jacobian are
relatively well-known in the scientific computing and numerical analysis
communities and are typically organized as a collection of "rules of thumb"
gained through experience.  What is not often realized, however, is that
these heuristic rules can be formally organized into a collection of simple
rules reminiscent of the rules for calculating derivatives in single-variable
calculus.

In this work, I have used a MATLAB-based notation to formalize several
differentiation rules for computing analytical Jacobians for discretized
nonlinear integro-differential equations {% cite 2009-Chu-JCP %}.
Using these rules can dramatically reduce

<ul>
  <li>the effort required to calculate analytical Jacobians and
  </li>
  <li>improve the computational performance of numerical algorithms that
  require the Jacobian.
