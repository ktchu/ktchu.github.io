<p>
It is possible to boost the order of accuracy of finite difference schemes
for time dependent PDEs by carefully choosing the time step.  The key
consequence of this result is that it may be possible to transform formally
low-order accurate finite difference schemes into high-order accurate
numerical methods with very little modification of both the original
numerical algorithm and software implementation.
