<p>
Structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) is a technique for improving the
computational performance of simulations on structured grids by focusing
computational resources where it is needed.  More precisely, SAMR achieves
high accuracy while controlling computational cost by restricting the use
of high resolution computational grids to regions where physical or
numerical considerations indicate that it is required.
</p>

<p>
To rapidly develop SAMR-based simulations, I leverage the
<a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/SAMRAI/">Structured Adaptive Mesh
  Refinement Application Infrastructure (SAMRAI)</a> developed in the
<a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/">Center for Applied Scientific
  Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore
  National Laboratory</a>.  SAMRAI is a large, C++ library that is designed
to support large-scale, parallel, structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR)
simulations without requiring application developers to implement low-level
parallel and/or SAMR algorithms. For example, SAMRAI shields application
developers from the low-level programming details involved with management of
bookkeeping for SAMR data structures and parallel communication.  In addition,
by adopting a patch-based (as opposed to a cell-based) refinement mechanism,
SAMRAI makes it relatively easy to migrate from serial codes written to solve
problems on simple, uniform grids to parallel and/or SAMR numerical
simulations.

<p>
I am currently involved in various projects where SAMR is used to improve
the computational performance of material science and biophysics simulations.
