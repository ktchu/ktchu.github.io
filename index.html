I am an independent research scientist who works in many fields of science and engineering.
My research tends to be highly interdisplinary and to reside at the interfaces between
traditional fields of study. When approaching problems, I strive to synergistically
integrate ideas from science, engineering, applied mathematics, and computational science &
engineering.

My current research projects focus on TODO scientific software development.
