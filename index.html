  As an independent research scientist, I work in many fields of science and engineering.
  My research tends to be interdisplinary and often resides at interfaces between
  traditional fields of study. When approaching problems, I strive to synergistically
  integrate ideas from science, engineering, applied mathematics, and computational science.

  As an independent STEM educator, I explore non-traditional mechanisms for supporting STEM
  education for students and early career individuals. My educational efforts tend to focus
  on providing opportunities for lateral growth and supplementing existing STEM education
  infrastructure. When teaching and mentoring, I strive to tune the learning strategy to
  the individual.
