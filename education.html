  My STEM education activities are concentrated in the following areas:
  </p>
  <ul class="mb-2">
    <li>
      mentoring research and practicum projects for high school/college/university students,
    </li>
    <li>
      running mathematics enrichment opportunities for middle and high school students,
    </li>
    <li>
      providing academic/career guidance and perspective, and
    </li>
    <li>
      building STEM student communities.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Research and Practicum Mentoring</h4>
  <p>
  To support students interested in gaining research and industry experience, I set up the
  <a href="https://www.velexi.com/outreach/">
    Velexi Research Scholars and Velexi STEAM Practicum
  </a> programs at Velexi. These programs are designed to expose students to technical and
  non-technical aspects of R&D projects.
  </p>

  <h4>Enrichment Programs</h4>
  <p>
  To support mathematically advanced middle and high school students in the San Mateo area,
  I co-founded the
  <a href="https://www.velexi.com/outreach/peninsula-math-circle/">
    Peninsula Math Circle
  </a> to introduce students to the beauty of mathematics by allowing them to engage with
  mathematical ideas and thinking beyond the standard math curriculum. Through the math
  circle, we hope students come to appreciate that mathematics is full of opportunities for
  exploration and discovery (and not a "dead topic" that is completely figured out).
  </p>

  <p>
  I also volunteer as a coach for the math team at the Burlingame Intermediate School and
  help students organize teams to compete at local middle school math competitions.
  </p>

  <h4>STEM Community Building</h4>
  <p>
  I work with teachers at the Burlingame Intermediate School to organize a Math Club where
  the primary goal is to foster a sense of community amongst academically-minded middle
  school students.
